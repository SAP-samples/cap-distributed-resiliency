##  1. Using write forwarding in an Amazon Aurora Global Database

This feature lets secondary clusters in an Aurora Global Database forward SQL statements that perform write operations to the primary cluster. The primary cluster updates the source and then propagates resulting changes back to all secondary AWS Regions.

The write forwarding configuration saves you from implementing your own mechanism to send write operations from a secondary AWS region to the primary region. Amazon Aurora handles the cross-region networking setup. Amazon Aurora also transmits all necessary session and transactional context for each statement. The data is always changed first on the primary cluster and then replicated to the secondary clusters in the Amazon Aurora Global Database. This way, the primary cluster is the source of truth and always has an up-to-date copy of all your data.

Enabling write forwarding is **not supported** for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, it works on the MySQL-Compatible Edition.

##  2. Using Amazon RDS Proxy 
Amazon RDS Proxy  is a fully managed, highly available database proxy for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) that makes applications more scalable, more resilient to database failures, and more secure.

Aurora global databases currently don't support Amazon RDS Proxy. Refer the section [Limitations of Amazon Aurora global databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database.html)

##  3. Using other proxies

HAProxy or Pgpool-II can be used for Load Balancing your PostgreSQL, but this has to be manually installed and configured in EC2 instance. The solution provides load balancing for read-only connections, but not read/write connections. The read/write traffic separation must be handled by the application at a connection level. Read-only connections can connect to the HAProxy load balancer instance, whereas the connections that intend to execute read/write queries should connect directly to the Cloud SQL primary instance.

##  4. Read/Write traffic separation in application layer

The load balancing with JDBC is pretty native, provide with the connection parameters can trigger the load balancing mechanism. We have implemented the same in our solution. Let us try Read/Write traffic separation using Spring transactional layer.

Spring provides a variation of DataSource, called AbstractRoutingDatasource. It can be used in place of standard DataSource implementations and enables a mechanism to determine which concrete DataSource to use for each operation at runtime. All you need to do is to extend it and to provide an implementation of an abstract determineCurrentLookupKey method. This is the place to implement your custom logic to determine the concrete DataSource.

## 5. Approximate Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
A Recovery point objectives refer to companyâ€™s loss tolerance. The amount of data that can be lost before significant harm to the business occurs.
